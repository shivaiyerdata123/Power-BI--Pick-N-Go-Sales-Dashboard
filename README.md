**Dataset Overview**

* Rows: 5,901

* Columns: 23 (Key ones: Order Date, Ship Mode, Segment, Region, Category, Sales, Quantity, Profit, Payment Mode)

* Geographic scope: United States

**Key Insights**

**1. Sales & Profit Distribution**

* Technology and Office Supplies drive the highest sales volume.

* Furniture contributes large revenue but lower margins — bookcases and tables often return negative profits.

* Technology (Phones, Accessories) yields higher profits per unit.

 **2. Customer Segments**

* Consumer segment generates the most sales, but Corporate and Home Office show higher profitability.

* Suggests B2B customers may offer steadier profit margins.

**3. Regional Performance**

* West region dominates both sales and profits.

* Central region shows frequent losses, especially in furniture sales — pricing and discounting may be a problem.

**4. Shipping & Delivery**

* Standard Class is the most common shipping mode.

* Same Day / First Class shipping increases costs, reducing profit margins, especially for low-value orders.

**5. Payment Modes**

* Majority of sales are through Online and Cards.

* Online payments seem linked with higher-order values compared to Cash.

**6. Profitability Risks**

* Certain product sub-categories (Bookcases, Tables, Supplies) frequently show negative profits.

* Discount-driven sales may be eroding margins.

**Recommendations**

* Product Strategy

* Reduce deep discounting on Furniture (Bookcases & Tables) where profits are consistently negative.

* Focus promotions on Technology & Accessories — strong profit generators.

* Regional Optimization

* Investigate Central region losses → review pricing, logistics, and discount strategy.

* Allocate more marketing resources to West region, where profitability is strong.

**Customer Segments**

* Expand Corporate & Home Office focus with loyalty or bulk-purchase incentives.

* For Consumers, optimize discounts (limit margin leakage).

* Shipping Efficiency

* Encourage Standard Class shipping for non-urgent orders.

* Bundle small orders to avoid high shipping costs eating into margins.

* Payment Strategy

* Incentivize online and card payments (higher order values).

* Minimize “cash on delivery” where possible due to operational overhead.

**Data Improvements**

* Track actual return rates to better estimate net profitability.
